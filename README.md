# Emacs Configuration

This repository describes my current emacs.d configuration. Most of the stuff has been taken from [emacs from scratch](https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch). The configuration comes in a literate programming format in which all the elisp code is tangled from the `emacs_configuration.org` file to the `init.el` file.

## Main Contents

This is a very minimal configuration of emacs that containts what is needed to run org-mode and EXWM (with polybar).
